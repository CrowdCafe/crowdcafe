						There are <b>real people</b> performing <b>real tasks</b> with <b>real data</b>, published by <b>real people</b> paying <b>real money</b>. So there is no place for cheating or any inappropriate behavior on the platform. The quality is controlled by injecting in datasets ground truth data and several other ways.
					</p>
					<p>
						CrowdCafe brings the best experience to tasks executors, so in case of not respectful behavior from the executors side we have to apply penalties and blocking accounts of violators.</p>

					<div class="content-block-inner">
						<p>
							People who publish tasks on this platform are academic researchers, commercial companies and governmental organisations. They publish here tasks which are very hard to perform automatically using any algorithms, while humans can still perform them well. The results collected in these tasks have a great scientific and commercial impact.
